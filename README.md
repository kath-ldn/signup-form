# Mint Sign-up Form Clone

## About

This is a clone of the sign-up for at [Mint.com](https://mint.intuit.com/), which I developed for (The Odin Project, HTML & CSS Module HTML Forms project)(https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms). The purpose of this was to practice creating forms.

### Live Demo

(GitHub pages)[https://kath-ldn.github.io/signup-form/]

### Built with

HTML & CSS

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements.

## Roadmap

None planned.

### Known Issues

* Spacing etc. isn't perfect - but point of challenge was to create similar form, which I have achieved. I tried to limit my use of Dev Tools to grabbing images etc. rather than getting precise details for margins etc. - to make sure I am practising rather than just copying.
* I didn't use a reset sheet - so it may look different on different browsers (I'm using Chrome).
